## **About the Project**
This system is built to manage airline operations, including flight management, user authentication, bookings, and notifications. By leveraging a microservices-based architecture, the project ensures:
- **Scalability**: Handles growing user demand with ease.
- **High Availability**: Ensures zero downtime through load balancing and distributed architecture.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains transactional consistency, especially during critical operations like seat booking.
- **Security**: Incorporates JWT-based authentication and encrypted user credentials.

---

## **Tech Stack**
### **Backend**
- **Node.js**: Runtime for building scalable, event-driven services.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight framework for building APIs.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Simplified database management and migrations.
- **RabbitMQ**: Efficient messaging system for asynchronous communication.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and rate limiting.

### **Database**
- **MySQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.
- **SQL Migrations**: Ensures version control for database schema.

### **Security**
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication for secure access.
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing to enhance security.

### **Infrastructure**
- **AWS EC2**: Cloud hosting for microservices.
- **AWS Load Balancer**: Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

### **Other Tools**
- **Docker**: Containerization of services.
- **Postman**: API testing and documentation.

## **Features**
1. **Flight Management**:
   - Manage CRUD operations for flights with a user-friendly API.
   - Robust SQL migrations for seamless schema updates.
2. **User Authentication**:
   - Secure login/signup with hashed passwords and token-based authentication.
3. **Flight Booking**:
   - Sophisticated seat selection mechanism.
   - Concurrency control to handle simultaneous bookings effectively.
4. **Notification Service**:
   - Asynchronous messaging for booking confirmations and alerts.
5. **API Gateway**:
   - Centralized routing with rate limiting and reverse proxy functionality.
